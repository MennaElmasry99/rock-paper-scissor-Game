Overview 
This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a player to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and play against the computer. The project is a great example of using basic web development technologies, focusing on control flow (if statements and switch cases), DOM manipulation, and class management with classList.

Features
 • Interactive UI: Users can click on their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) to play.
 • Computer Opponent: The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
 • Result Display: The game announces the result (win, lose, draw) after each round.
 • Dynamic Styling: CSS classes are dynamically added/removed using JavaScript's classList for a visually engaging experience.
Technologies Used
 • HTML: Structure and layout of the game.
 • CSS: Styling for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
 • JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity, including:
 • if statements and switch cases for game decision making.
 • DOM manipulation to update the UI dynamically.
 • classList for adding and removing CSS classes based on game events.
